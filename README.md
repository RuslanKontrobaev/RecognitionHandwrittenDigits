# Recognition Handwritten Digits
Neural network based on a multilayer perceptron for handwritten digit recognition

For training and testing, MNIST training and test samples are used, respectively

After training and testing the network, the program loads handwritten numbers in the format of 28x28 pixels from 0 to 9, which are then converted into a file.CSV, similar to MNIST.  Then the operation of the perceptron on this set is checked, the effectiveness of its recognition is evaluated
